# LINKS
## Here are a bunch of links to resources I commonly access for OS related stuff:
* [Operating Systems Concepts 10th Ed.](https://os.ecci.ucr.ac.cr/slides/Abraham-Silberschatz-Operating-System-Concepts-10th-2018.pdf) - I use this as a primary source
* [Vim shortcuts](https://vim.rtorr.com/) - Because Vim is not VSCode
* [os.vlsm.org](os.vlsm.org) - Where the assignments are
* [How do GPG and SSH keys work?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymmetric-key-cryptography/)
